I got a meatball sub for my husband and it is the most terrible driest sandwich ever! The lady sandwich maker had so many problems because i asked her to cut the meat balls in half. She did it on paper and left the sauce on the paper. When i asked her to put mote on the sandwich, she said there wasn't any sauce. This sandwich is gross. And my dog didn't even like it. This used to be my favorite subway. It sure isn't anymore. Now it's the worst. Bummer. Every employee there used to be totally awesome. Not anymore.

This is the best Subway I have ever been to and I've eaten at several. The customer service is awesome and I don't know but for some reason the sandwiches here just taste better I recommend this Subway to anyone",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8KW8TRQUVPCav9X2Hq2NCR3qu478L9grvdodu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],

Within a minute or so I got my big breakfast 🥞 with hot cakes and everything was delicious as McDonald’s is! I’ll be coming back here a lot since I live in the neighborhood next to it! Thanks McDonald’s 🙂","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNto5I0tFNk3MG3ZUqvHfuvTIb7yODjHRkUhpix=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdcnsgMNFmeayG6_j-HlK61gmLx4Csgor4BO6G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLvejwhG8B_2kQH1fJ1z2LEWG0kkX-RheBVTb4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDBUc6ehfazHxN1TSQZEB_mnqjpAB0vTi9ep-2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-5IilFdnfX4BWzVcciuLZKb1rK7zZxbAY4Cqf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1MUllnqycE6w8XyWW9KXuQIi_boNoHdUJ9Aaj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP46vdv1xdjn21yPR1gI2CZ2BOShpp0d0R2FBKJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOafdDZM79G1oIP9JbzVI1q7g45qrJHxQnLlu05=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV1SsUl1CVoE23WcY3L5_qNBtvlOygGWnAk_71=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQVXnhXn19ghItJesPLTdLUSOBK7OZcV4UbxRb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOWZOqsn8HwNXqQMPV19p6SBxLGCUtISxXD7xv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3YffPI2vaPuKwxPkwcacezDXDFuLnxgQJrBv5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMf9Lqg3k_328DcLgaRUAM6juIsj-BvWSv2OjqF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIND4JMhd5KjyVOdMk8P6T4jxXFAIYHQQ5sH01=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-0WPUT-_KahHVR-tuilT_Ano38y9HaoZ4ureh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJP8RYgQwxtOm1ql6e5AsyzxrGDvSYx8DOjvrd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS_H0mcuT2ptfwGj9CIbXYQhHTb5WkCocjZVpH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLW2KKEtLqoijfYek_BRPuXk35S7cboZeKhnVq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",

Hema owner is a nice lady she knows how to talk to her employees but her husband Rahul he is the worst owner I ever worked with. He doesn't know how to treat his employee's. He is so cheap that's the only word for him *CHEAP*. He always tried to belittle me from the very first day i started working. He never appreciate his employees. One of the customer asked me to put more veggies on the sandwich he got mad at me and said don't put that much veggies instead charge customer more for veggies. I have been working in another Subway since 3 years we never charge the customer for extra veggies. I request everyone to check their receipt. They even use the same ice tea whole day. It's not even fresh I was about to throw it around 7 o clock evening. Food inspector was there too. He told me in front of inspector that am I going to serve ice tea from the drain if i throw it.  That doesn't even make sense. I was new to the store so I didn't say anything i kept it back whereas i know ice tea should be made after 4 hours. He tells us to switch off the a/c too early or it has some kind of automatic setting it's not even the right  temperature to work there. He is doing everything against the law. Even the food served there is not at the right temperature.  I have seen fungus on the flatbreads. It's the worst Subway I have ever worked in.  Please try and avoid eating in this store.,,

I asked him if I could do their $6 deal that comes with turkey and ham and have him just leave the ham off. He originally told me he couldn't do that, which I thought was odd, but if that was a rule, it's not his fault and I was fine with it.  But as I was explaining that to my husband next to me who hadn't heard him, he suddenly changed his mind and told me he'd just do turkey. At the register, he charged us $2 more saying that he couldn't ring it up as the $6 meal because there was no ham! I wasn't asking for more turkey than they normally would have done with that sandwich... or anything extra at all, I just wanted him to not do the step where he adds ham which I think is a pretty common dietary restriction.  I would have picked the ham off myself if he had not changed his mind in the middle of the sandwich and told me he'd do it.

Also I am not sure what the decision making process was when they decided this but there is another subway literally two blocks down (you can probably see it from this one) and that one is larger and more pleasant. I am guessing this one survives based  entirely on it's proximity to Market street and busy businessmen in a hurry to get a sandwich and get back to the office.,,

While waiting for my son's bus to arrive (2:40pm, Fri.), I decided to order a sandwich and a salad to go. Right after ordering the sandwich she jumped to the next customer without asking if I needed anything else. I was still standing where the food is ordered so I told her that I wasn't done ordering and that I also needed a salad. She practically rolled her eyes ,turned around and walk away without saying a word, then returned and gave a big breath and asked me ""what salad you want"". By then I have felt the bad vibe, energy or however people want to call it. I decided that I better don't order the salad, hey no need to eat food prepared in a bad manner. I told her to don't worry about it, that I didn't want it anymore.  She raised her voice on me and asked me again, ""what salad do you want"", of course stressing every single syllable of each word. I told her again that I didn't want it anymore, she cut me off and again in a demanding high tone level voice, ask me again, like trying to force me to order something since she had already walked 3 steps to get the plate.
I got upset and asked the other nice girl if there was a supervisor or manager on duty, she pointed at the person that was almost screaming at me...her response to me? ""AND THERE YOU HAVE IT""
That is totally unacceptable and unprofessional. I have to be there weekly but even if I am hungry after traveling all the way from Watertown, NY, I won't buy there anymore.

She was distracted by the man she was talking to because he had a pack of cigarettes and I guess she wanted to go smoke with him. I waited for her to wash her hands but she proceeded by just putting on gloves. Then she starts to take my order. Long story short she told me it would be extra for cheese on my chicken bacon ranch belt. My husband and I only order that every time we come to subway. And I told her that the sub comes with two cheese and she told me not at this location. So I told her I will just go to the location across the street. I wasn't really bummed out about the extra price. It was really that she didn't wash her hands and was carrying on a silent conversation about cigarettes that made me walk away. Gross!

The service is better than average for a  McDonald's, and the food is surprisingly fresh and good.
I usually don't rate anything above or below average until I've been there at least three times.
Of the three McDonald's in the Humble area that I usually go to, this is could become my favorite.
What is really surprising is that this is a small McDonald's just inside the doors of a Super Walmart, so it is extremely busy at times, but they can't really have a lot of people working there.

Why four stars...?

When you order from a subway...it still tastes like subway. Not enough meat. Not enough cheese. It's the same no matter wher you go.

I think 376 and Hopewell are same owners with similar reviews.

Update on 10/5. Never say never. I gave them the benefit of new ownership and change. Much friendlier staff but still no good on product. Bread was stale day old and 2 slices each of ham, pepperoni and cheese on a six inch. That was it for me.",,

Tell your customers that if they do not live their life glued to a smartphone, the staff can do nothing to help you.

If you are short-staffed and running behind, that is a management problem, not mine.  Modify your order estimate algorithm.  Do not come up with more and more excuses when it is clear you have no idea what happened to my order.

Tell your customers that if their order is the oldest order, the orders of those walking in the door come first.  You just have to wait because you were inconvenient and asked difficult questions.  You go to the back of the line, even though the system said your order would be ready some time ago.

And do not ask the name of the franchise owner.  That must be top secret.

Bottom line:  your order estimate system is a farce.  I would have been time ahead if I had come in live and ordered live, like the customers that came in behind me.  Perhaps they know better.

And how do I get off your damn mailing list?",,

I went to this subway and purchased a tuna sandwich for my client who is disabled. When she tasted it, she told me it didn’t taste good and it smelled funny. When I smelled it, I told her don’t eat anymore of it. I went back to the location and the manager Ann stared it was fresh and I can’t return the sandwich. She then continued taking other customers and then told me to taste the tuna. She gave my client tuna on a piece of cucumber and she said this one taste much better. But still Ann told us we can’t return the sandwich, she then began speaking to her staff in her language. I asked her what level of customer service was this. She continued to ignore me and my client. A gentleman came from the kitchen and he offered to make us a new sandwich. I put in a complaint and received a general email from a manager named Kevin saying “ I’m sorry you had a bad experience, we hope to continue serving you in the future🧐. I’m confused on many levels. I will be contacting corporate on Monday because Clearly no one is trained here. With the exception of Eddie who offered and made my client a new sandwich. I will never ever go here and I will inform my agency to not allow our clients to go here.",,

I asked for a little bit of oil on my sandwich and the guy just proceeds to add vinegar. When I asked why he was adding vinegar he said he assumed I wanted oil AND vinegar. When I said no he just laughed it off and said sorry. So I paid full price for a sandwich with something I did not want on it. I should have known that going to a subway inside a Wal-Mart was a bad idea to begin with.,,

There was only one person working at the time, which is absolutely terrible management. I tried multiple times to get her attention along the way, but she continued to only prioritize the people in line (which continued to grow).

Tonight I interacted with a shift supervisor named Ashley. During our entire interaction in the store, Ashley was unmasked. According to Ashley:

1. The store is NOT required to answer incoming calls unless it's a ""double ring"" for a manager (I'm not sure what this means.)

2. If you're doing curbside delivery, the store often does not receive the ""I'm here"" notification. So if you have kids in tow or you're hoping to social distance, you're more than likely going to have to leave your vehicle and go into the store.

3. The store typically does not receive the ""alerts"" from the customer service call center.

Tonight was my first visit to the Austell Pizza Hut. I placed an order for curbside pickup. Upon my arrival, I selected the ""I'm here"" button in my order confirmation email. I waited several minutes but no one ever came out. From my car, I could see a middle-aged woman sitting at the counter eating Funyuns and playing on her phone. I assumed that they were putting the finishing touches on my order and since they had my vehicle information, I continued to wait.

After several minutes, I decided to call just to check on the status. I selected the store option a couple of times, but no one answered, and I was eventually transferred to the call center. The customer service representative was convinced that my notification had not reached the store, so he asked me to wait with him while he sent three additional alerts. He told me that my order was already ready and someone would be out right away. From my car I could see that the woman at the counter continued to play on her phone, chat with coworkers, and gobble down her Funyuns. Finally the customer service representative offered to transfer me back to the store. Still, no one answered, so I was forced to go into the store.

Once in the store I discovered that the woman at the counter was Ashley. I shared my experience and to my surprise, Ashley was indifferent and unconcerned. I asked if this was the usual experience and she threw her hands up. She explained that they are not required to answer phone calls and the curbside notifications are often not received. I asked as a customer, what recourse would I have in this situation. Ashley shrugged so I asked for the manager. Ashley insisted that she was the manager, so I asked for the General Manager's information and I planned to follow up with a phone call. She provided the information, but became very antagonistic with me.

She tossed the pizza on counter and went to return to her seat. No pleasantries, no thank you, no apology. Ashley explained that she did not like my attitude because I came into the store already frustrated. Admittedly, I was frustrated with the situation- but respectful- and I expected to find an ally in the manager. I agreed that yes, I was frustrated, but as the manager I honestly thought that if I shared my experience with her she would offer reassurance, assistance, or at the very least, an apology to diffuse my frustration. Ashley became enraged by my remark and began the raise her voice with ""Don't tell me how to do my job! You don't get to tell me how to do my job!"" At this time I realized that Ashley was becoming quite agitated and it was not wise it to continue the conversation. I took the pen and decided to write down the General Manager's information. Ashley asked me why was I still there. Shocked, I explained that I was writing down the information. She told me that I could take my food- or not- and get out of her store.

I did not feel appreciated as a customer nor was my time valued. Moreover, my experience with the staff was beyond unprofessional. I will not patronize this location again.",,

Why?  Well, I'm finally rolling out of bed, massively hungover and have a serious craving for Thanksgiving staple  - mashed potatoes and gravy.  Once I get here, I'm baffled by the menu - not because it's poorly set up, but because I""m terribly hungover.  I just can't seem to figure out where the items I think I want (Mashed Potatoes & Gravy and Mac N Cheese) are on the darn board.  I give up and decide to order a tender combo - shoot, it comes with a desperately needed soda.  Because I was not quite functional, I don't consider, process or realize that I can probably sub the potato wedges in the combo for another side - so, I shout at the lady that I'd also like family sides of the above mentioned items.  Sweet!  I just scored 3 tenders, a biscuit, potato wedges, mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes with gravy (and a soda) for like $10.  Let's not talk about how much of a fatty I was going to be within 15 minutes in my bed while watching Dr. Who.  This was heaven.

Only one negative.  Gravy isn't a dipping sauce.  Wahut?  No seriously.  The cashier asks what I'd like to go with my tenders - Ranch, Honey Mustard or BBQ.  By default, I naturally spout, ""gravy"", and she says, ""that's not a dipping sauce option"".  So terribly heartbreaking.  Long before these other condiments (ahem, dressings), great grandmothers around the world were whisking up grease, water, flour and pepper to accompany fried chicken.  Dang it - Gravy IS a dipping sauce!",,
